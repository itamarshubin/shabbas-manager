this code looks like shit, so feal free to pr me

how to use:

1. go to google firebase and get yourself firebaseConfig.
2. put it in the app.
3. the bot is running



my setup is ec2 in aws.
I didn't use Docker, so if you want your project to run on linux (at least ubuntu) you need to install all the packages in the Docker file.
